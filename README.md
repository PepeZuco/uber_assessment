# Uber Trip Duration Prediction Assessment

This repository contains code and data for predicting the duration of Uber rides in SÃ£o Paulo. The project aims to improve trip duration prediction accuracy through data analysis and machine learning models. The repository is organized to facilitate data cleaning, processing, model building, and analysis.

## Repository Structure

- `data_cleaning/`
  - Contains scripts for cleaning and processing the data.
  - **`data_processing.py`**: Generates cleaned datasets from raw input data.
  - **`run.py`**: Executes the data processing workflow using `data_processing.py`.
  - **`EDA.py`**: A Jupyter notebook that explains the steps in `data_processing.py` and the rationale behind the data cleaning process.

- `models/`
  - Contains scripts for training and testing models.
  - **`model_pipeline.py`**: Handles model training and testing.
  - **`run.py`**: Runs the model pipeline, utilizing `model_pipeline.py`.
  - `Graphs/`: Stores all graphs generated during model training.
  - `trained_model/`: Stores the model trained.

- `PowerPoint/`
  - Contains a Jupyter notebook for generating graphs for presentations and a .pptx file.
  - **`graph_generator.ipynb`**: Generates graphs specifically for presentations.
  - `Graphs/`: Stores all presentation-related graphs.

- `data_extra/`
  - Stores additional datasets.
- `data_final/`
  - Stores cleaned datasets.
- `data_original/`
  - Stores original datasets.
